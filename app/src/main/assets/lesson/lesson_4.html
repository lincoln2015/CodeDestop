	<h3>Lesson 4 Cognos Enterprise</h3>
	<P>Cognos (Cognos Incorporated) was an Ottawa, Ontario-based
		company making business intelligence (BI) and performance management
		(PM) software. Founded in 1969, at its peak Cognos employed almost
		3,500 people and served more than 23,000 customers in over 135
		countries. Originally Quasar Systems Limited, it adopted the Cognos
		name in 1982. Cognos is a fragment scissored off the Latin word
		"cognosco," which means "knowledge from personal experience".[2]
		January 31, 2008, Cognos was officially acquired by IBM.[3] The Cognos
		name continues to be applied to IBM's line of business intelligence
		and performance management products. In January 2010, as part of a
		reorganization of IBM Software Group, Cognos software and software
		from recently acquired SPSS were brought together to create the
		Business Analytics division.</p>

		If, during installation, you opted to manually install the report
		server, configure the WebSphere Application Server instance to host
		the report server, and build, deploy, and install the enterprise
		archive (EAR) files. Cognos was founded in 1969 by Alan Rushforth and
		Peter Glenister.Michael Potter joined Cognos in 1972. It began as a
		consulting company for the Canadian federal government and offered its
		first software product, QUIZ, in 1979. During the Canadian recession
		in the 1980s, Cognos shifted its focus from consulting to software
		sales. In 1995, Ron Zambonini was named CEO and brought new marketing
		strategies. Cognos grew successful with its business intelligence
		products for local area networks (LAN), but new Internet technologies
		had come into the BI industry faster than the company had anticipated.
		After Cognos issued a notice informing shareholders of a slowdown in
		growth, many sold their shares, causing prices to fall quickly. This
		prompted Cognos to build its web technology through the acquisition of
		other companies rather than internal research and development. In
		September 2007, Cognos announced that it would be acquiring Applix.</br>It
		had previously acquired 4Thought, Relational Matters, LEX2000,
		Interweave, DecisionStream, NoticeCast, Adaytum, Frango, Databeacon
		and Celequest, an operational intelligence company.</P>
